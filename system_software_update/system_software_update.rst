.. codelab:: Introduction

   CodeBug Connect has a tiny 'Operating System' that does various tasks in the background. Every so often we will provide an update that might fix bugs or add extra functionality.
   
   .. note:: You're in control! CodeBug Connect will never automatically update itself, only at your request, and you can chose which version you want it to update to.


.. codelab:: Preparing for the update

   Before updating your CodeBug Connect, ensure:

   #. You have a backup of any programs and data on your CodeBug Connect, just in case!
   #. You're powering your CodeBug Connect from a good quality USB power supply
   #. You have an account on the CodeBug website
   #. Your CodeBug Connect has a WiFi connection setup and it's been Adopted on the CodeBug Website

   .. warning:: Check everything on the list before proceeding!
