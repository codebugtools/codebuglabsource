.. codelab:: Introduction

   This guide will show you how to adopt your CodeBug Connect on the CodeBug Connect Website. Once setup, you'll be able to:

   * update the system software on your CodeBug Connect
   * send new programs to your CodeBug Connect from the website
   * store and log data online from your CodeBug Connect -- for example you could record air quality and monitor it remotely from your smartphone

.. codelab:: Setup WiFi

   .. important:: Before following this guide your CodeBug must be able to connect to WiFi. Follow the :codeguide:`Set up Wifi<setting-up-wifi>` guide if you haven't done already.

.. include:: ../partials/full_steps/sign_in.rst

.. codelab:: Download your key

    #. From the main menu, choose ``CODEBUG CONNECT`` â†’ ``MY CODEBUG CONNECTS``

        :align: center

    #. Click ``Download Key`` button to download your unique key. Your browser will download a file named ``adoption_key.dat`` -- store it somewhere on your computer as you'll need to copy it onto your CodeBug in a later step.

.. include:: ../partials/full_steps/msd_mode.rst

.. codelab:: Transfer the key

    #. Copy the downloaded ``adoption_key.dat`` file into the top level directory (not in a sub-folder) of your CodeBug Connect.

    #. Eject (or for some operating systems unmount) the CodeBug Connect USB disk. Wait until the end of the next step before unplugging.

    #. On most computers (though not some Apple Computers) the yellow file icon on CodeBug Connect will turn green, indicating when it's safe to unplug.

       On later updates CodeBug Connect will scroll a message requesting it is unplugged.

.. codelab:: Restart CodeBug Connect

    As part of the adoption progress you should see your CodeBug Connect appear on the ``MY CODEBUG CONNECTS`` when your CodeBug Connect next boots up and connects to the Internet.

    #. Have the ``MY CODEBUG CONNECTS`` page open in your browser.

    #. Reapply power to your CodeBug Connect.

    #. Watch the display of your CodeBug Connect and check it successfully connects to the WiFi.

    #. Wait for your new CodeBug Connect to appear

       .. tip:: Write the name you've given your CodeBug on a label on the back of your physical bug then it's easy to identify.

.. codelab:: Adoption Complete

    If you've not already done so, you're now ready to create your first program and transfer it to your CodeBug Connect over WiFi.
